    This is a Word Search Generator. It allows you to creat a Word Search by entering the size you would like 
    the word search to be (must be a square and less and 20) and a list of words you would like to be in the 
    word search. This project complies with the specifications because it takes an unbounded number of parameters from the 
    command line(a positive int < 21 and the words to be hidden). It then hides all the given words in the puzzle 
    by randomly picking a position and direction. If the word does not fit it cycles through all other positions and
    directions until it finds a location that works. If their is not location that works then the program is terminated
    and the word that couldn't be fit is diplayed. Finally, at the end of the program, the puzzle and list of words
    is printed for the user.
