01/23/2025: Started project. Messed around in Emacs and Command Prompt to figure out how things worked.
            - Also messed around with stuff in VSCode and decided to wirte the code in VSCode then test it
            with Pyrite to make sure it works with that too.
            - Got annoyed with VSCode not working the same as emacs and decided to work in emacs instead
	    	due to compiler in VSCode not working the same as stuff inclass
	    	- Wrote out steps in comments that I want to do
	    	- Got downward, rightward, diagonal up, and diagonal down placement working without worrying 
	    	about invalid placements  or multiple words/overlapping words
	    	- Bugs Include: Multiple typing errors (Spelling, hit wrong key), I was using the test word 
	   		dogs and placement was allowed even when the word was too long for the direction it was going
01/24/2025: Attempted to make the code rotate through directions and positions if it was detected that the
			word would not fit in the spot but failed. Ended up taking what I had of my code and going 
			through the whole thing and rewriting it but in a simpler way in order to understand it better
			- I also added more comments and used comment lines to divide code to make it easier to read
			- Realized I need to practice working with pointers
01/25/2025: Added functionality to rotated through directions and positions when the spot did not have enough
			room for the words.
			- Looked into how to use pointers and simplified code further
			- Added the funcionality to check for letters and if the letter matches the corresponding locaiton 
			in the word the word will still be placed but if the letter is different the code iterates to next
			position or direction
			- Bugs fixed: Issue in incrementing when determining when to take the position from the bottom right
			corner of the table to the top left: fixed, Flaw in logic determining if diagonal up word would fit:
			fixed
			- Implemented adding randomly generated letters into the remaining open spots in the word search
			- Commented out everything used for debugging and checking
			- Finished code
